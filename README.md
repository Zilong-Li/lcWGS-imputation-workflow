This workflow is for imputation using low coverage whole genome sequencing data with *QUILT*. Also, it can perform benchmarking for both *QUILT* and *GLIMPSE* given different scenarios.

## Dependencies

- QUILT (QUILT_prepare_reference.R, QUILT.R)
- GLIMPSE v2.0 (GLIMPSE2_split_reference, GLIMPSE2_phase, GLIMPSE2_ligate)
- GLIMPSE v1.1.1 (GLIMPSE_chunk, GLIMPSE_phase, GLIMPSE_ligate)
- samtools
- bcftools
